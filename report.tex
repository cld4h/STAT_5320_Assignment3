\doublespacing
	%\singlespacing,\onehalfspacing,\doublespacing can be set and everything thereafter will use that spacing. You can switch within the document as often as you wish
	
\usepackage{parskip}
%changes paragraphs to have an extra space and new indentation with paragraphs, rather than indenting every new paragraph. This is completely a stylistic choice and neither is better than the other.


\usepackage{mathtools,amssymb} %useful math stuff. there are a lot of ams* packages. If you have a math need, it's probably in there

	
	
%\usepackage{natbib}
%\usepackage{biblatex} %natbib is older and available from almost all journals, biblatex is not, but biblatex has more flexibility and options.

%\usepackage[natbib=true]{biblatex} %this often works and requires minimal changes 

%for biblatex you write \textcite{citekey} and \parencite{citekey}
%for natbib you write \citet{citekey} and \citep{citekey}. Please avoid using \cite{} since you won't control whether it's parenthetical, but you are responsible for whether you use something in text or parenthetically.
%for \usepackage[natbib=true]{biblatex} you follow the natbib style and you won't have to perform search/replaces in your document, you would only need to change the package call and bibliography call.

\section{Question 1}

\textbf{Because your response is binary (0 or 1), and you are modelling its expected value, what is your kernel smoother actually modelling? Hint: one of two words, both of which start with p.}

\underline{Probability}

\[
P(\text{isGentoo}=1 \mid \mathbf{x}_0) = \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} K_\lambda\left( \mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_i \right) y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} K_\lambda\left( \mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_i \right)}
